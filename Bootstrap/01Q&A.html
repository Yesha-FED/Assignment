    <p>Step 3: We can add various col properties for making our page responsive, like col-sm-6 or col-md-3.</p>
    <p>Step 4: You need to create an anchor tag <a>, with a class name - .thumbnail wrapped around an image tag.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Q.8 In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout.</p>

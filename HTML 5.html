    <h1>Q.3 Semantic element in HTML5?</h1>
    <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the
        browser and the developer.
        Examples of semantic elements:
        <!-- <form> , <table> , and <article> -->
        - Clearly defines its content.
    </p>
    <h1>Q.4 Canvas and SVG tags</h1>
    <p>SVG uses geometric shapes to render graphics, whereas Canvas uses pixels.
        This means that SVG graphics are resolution-independent,
        which means they can be resized without losing quality,
        whereas Canvas graphics become blurry and distorted when resized.</p>
